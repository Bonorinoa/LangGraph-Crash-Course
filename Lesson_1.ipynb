        "## Introduction to LangGraph\n",
        "\n",
        "If you've ever tried to build something with an LLM, or at least have been keeping up with the field, you've probably heard of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/). Harrison Chase first launched it in October 2022 as an open-source tool for orchestrating LLM-based applications. It was a huge success, and just months after its initial release, the team secured millions of dollars to continue developing the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, LangChain is a tool for creating [Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafo_ac%C3%ADclico_dirigido) where nodes are powered by LLMs and are sequentially \"chained\". The key property of a DAG is that it has no cycles or loops. Given a query, it will pass information sequentially to all nodes. Routing is allowed, but there's no way to return to a previous node once executed. It facilitates the development of structured workflows, what I call \"recipes\", like [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://medium.com/@agbonorino/a-recipe-for-your-custom-rag-application-256137bc3ddc) chatbots. But it doesn't provide the autonomy and loop mechanisms that AI Agents promise to offer. LangGraph is their solution to this limitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inspired by the Python graph visualization package [NetworkX](https://www.bing.com/search?q=networkx&cvid=7eb500aabf7444cc92118e82ea499cc3&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBAAGEDSAQgzMDk0ajBqNKgCALACAA&FORM=ANAB01&PC=SCOOBE), this framework facilitates the development of cyclic and stateful workflows with built-in persistence features to incorporate memory. It differs from other frameworks like [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) or [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) by providing low-level control over the creation of Agent workflows. That is, you can build your workflows from scratch instead of having to rely on predefined Agents. The obvious downside is a steeper learning curve. But, everything in life is a trade-off. I hope this article guides you in the right direction and saves you valuable hours of your time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Fundamentals\n",
        "\n",
        "There are three fundamental building blocks for any LangGraph Agent workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **State**: A dictionary or named data structure (e.g., Pydantic BaseModel or a typing TypedDict object) that stores data that needs to be maintained throughout the graph. It's available to all nodes and there can be multiple States to define [multiple schemas](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#multiple-schemas).\n",
        "    - Importantly, all states typically implement a [reducer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#reducers) that defines how updates will be incorporated (e.g., adding to a list of messages to dynamically build a chat history or simply overwriting the current value).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Nodes**: The Building Blocks of Work: Each node in a LangGraph represents a distinct unit of work or action within the application. Each node is a Python function or a [LangChain Runnable](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/) that performs operations to update the State. It generally takes a State object and returns an update to the State. This task could involve a variety of operations, such as:\n",
        "    - Direct communication with an LLM for text generation, summarization, or other language-based tasks.\n",
        "    - Interaction with external tools and APIs to fetch data or perform real-world actions. In this case, we'll refer to the node as a \"tool\".\n",
        "    - Data manipulation through processes like formatting, filtering, or transformation.\n",
        "    - User interaction to gather information or display data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Edges**: Guiding Information Flow and Control: Edges serve as the connective tissue within a LangGraph, establishing paths for information flow between nodes and dictating the sequence of operations. LangGraph supports multiple types of edges:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - ***Simple Edges***: These denote a direct and unconditional flow from one node to another. The output of the first node feeds as input to the next node, creating a linear progression.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - ***Conditional Edges***: Introducing a layer of dynamism, conditional edges allow the workflow to branch based on the outcome of a specific node's operation. These enable the cyclic feature we discussed; a function will continue to be called until a condition is met.\n"

        "Quick recap. We've seen the basic components of any langgraph workflow, which are: 1) A Graph (set of nodes and edges), and 2) a State (TypedDict or Python Pydantic class). We can use graphs without any State. However, if we want to have specific pieces of information available at any point in the workflow (whether it's context for an LLM or inputs for a function), then State is essential to define a data schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "So far, we've only considered linear workflows. An input is provided at the START node and operations are applied sequentially. In reality, most interesting problems aren't linear. This is where LangGraph truly shines, allowing us to set up cyclic workflows to iterate based on specific criteria. The building block for unlocking these applications is the conditional edge, the focus of this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create this edge, you need to provide three things:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **The upstream node**: the output of this node will be analyzed to determine what to do next\n",
        "- **A function**: this will be called to determine which node to call next. It must return a string\n",
        "- **A mapping**: this mapping will be used to assign the output of the function in (2) to another node. The keys must be possible values that the function in (2) could return. The values must be node names to go to if that value is returned."

It is a crucial mechanism that facilitates the allocation of resources, coordinates the actions of buyers and sellers, and reflects the relative scarcity of goods and services.\\n\\n**Key Characteristics of Price**\\n\\n1. **Relative Value**: Price is a relative concept, meaning it is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market. It reflects the relative value of a good or service compared to other goods and services.\\n2. **Subjective Value**: Price is a subjective measure, as it is determined by the valuations of individual buyers and sellers. Each person's willingness to pay or accept a price is influenced by their personal preferences, needs, and circumstances.\\n3. **Market-Determined**: Price is determined by the market forces of supply and demand, rather than by any external authority or government intervention.\\n4. **Dynamic**: Price is not a fixed or static concept. It can fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, technological advancements, and other market factors.\\n\\n**Functions of Price**\\n\\n1. **Resource Allocation**: Price helps to allocate resources efficiently by directing them towards their most valuable uses.\\n2. **Coordination**: Price facilitates the coordination of economic activity by providing a common language and framework for buyers and sellers to communicate and negotiate.\\n3. **Information**: Price conveys information about the relative scarcity and value of goods and services, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.\\n4. **Incentives**: Price provides incentives for producers to innovate, improve quality, and reduce costs, as well as for consumers to make rational purchasing decisions.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn conclusion, price is a multifaceted concept that plays a vital role in the functioning of markets. It reflects the relative scarcity and value of goods and services, facilitates resource allocation and coordination, conveys information, and provides incentives for economic activity. As an Austrian economics professor, I emphasize the importance of understanding price as a subjective, market-determined, and dynamic concept that is essential for a well-functioning economy.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='46b7de08-e346-43f2-920e-ba6c49b7f102')]}\n",

As the money supply increases, the demand for goods and services rises, leading to higher prices. This is because the increased money supply chases a constant quantity of goods, driving up their prices. Inflation, therefore, is a monetary phenomenon, and price is a key indicator of its presence.

As an economy grows, the demand for goods and services increases, leading to higher prices. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. In a growing economy, higher prices can reflect increased productivity, innovation, and economic efficiency. The price mechanism helps to allocate resources towards the most valuable uses, driving economic growth and prosperity.\\n\\n**International Trade:**\\nPrice is a key determinant of international trade patterns. The law of comparative advantage, which states that countries should specialize in producing goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost, is closely tied to price.

By adjusting interest rates, central banks can affect the money supply, credit availability, and, ultimately, the price level.\\n2. **Fiscal Policy:** Government spending and taxation can also impact the price level. Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending, can lead to higher prices, while contractionary policies, such as tax increases, can lead to lower prices.\\n3. **Exchange Rates:** Changes in exchange rates can affect the price of imported goods and, subsequently, the overall price level. A depreciation of the exchange rate can make imports more expensive, leading to higher prices, while an appreciation can make imports cheaper, leading to lower prices.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of price is a fundamental aspect of macroeconomics, influencing inflation, economic growth, international trade, and other macroeconomic phenomena.

Indeed, the concept of price extends far beyond the microeconomic realm, influencing macroeconomic phenomena in profound ways. Let us delve into the intricacies of price's relationship with inflation, economic growth, and international trade.\\n\\n**Inflation:**\\nPrice plays a pivotal role in the inflation process. As the money supply increases, the demand for goods and services rises, leading to higher prices. This is because the increased money supply chases a constant quantity of goods, driving up their prices. Inflation, therefore, is a monetary phenomenon, and price is a key indicator of its presence. The general price level, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is a widely used metric to track inflation.\\n\\n**Economic Growth:**\\nPrice is also a crucial factor in economic growth. As an economy grows, the demand for goods and services increases, leading to higher prices. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. In a growing economy, higher prices can reflect increased productivity, innovation, and economic efficiency. The price mechanism helps to allocate resources towards the most valuable uses, driving economic growth and prosperity.\\n\\n**International Trade:**\\nPrice is a key determinant of international trade patterns. The law of comparative advantage, which states that countries should specialize in producing goods for which they have a lower opportunity cost, is closely tied to price. Countries with lower production costs or more efficient production processes will export goods at lower prices, while importing goods at higher prices. This leads to a more efficient allocation of resources globally, as countries specialize in producing goods for which they have a comparative advantage.\\n\\n**Additional Macroeconomic Aspects:**\\nPrice also influences other macroeconomic phenomena, such as:\\n\\n1. **Monetary Policy:** Central banks use interest rates to influence the price level and, subsequently, inflation expectations. By adjusting interest rates, central banks can affect the money supply, credit availability, and, ultimately, the price level.\\n2. **Fiscal Policy:** Government spending and taxation can also impact the price level. Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending, can lead to higher prices, while contractionary policies, such as tax increases, can lead to lower prices.\\n3. **Exchange Rates:** Changes in exchange rates can affect the price of imported goods and, subsequently, the overall price level. A depreciation of the exchange rate can make imports more expensive, leading to higher prices, while an appreciation can make imports cheaper, leading to lower prices.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of price is a fundamental aspect of macroeconomics, influencing inflation, economic growth, international trade, and other macroeconomic phenomena. Understanding the role of price in these areas is essential for policymakers, economists, and business leaders seeking to navigate the complexities of the global economy.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='577999d6-5293-4181-a482-f0c0c8e05301'), HumanMessage(content='Here\\'s a question that could lead to this response:\\n\\n\"What are some key ways in which the concept of price extends beyond the microeconomic realm and influences macroeconomic phenomena, such as inflation, economic growth, and international trade?\"', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c066dfe6-4bf7-49a9-9e82-90b126613641'), HumanMessage(content='The concept of price is a fundamental building block of economics, extending far beyond the microeconomic realm to influence various macroeconomic phenomena. Here are some key ways in which price affects macroeconomic outcomes:\\n\\n1. **Inflation**: Prices are a key driver of inflation, which is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy. As prices rise, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, leading to a decrease in the standard of living. Inflation can be caused by an increase in aggregate demand, a decrease in aggregate supply, or an increase in the money supply.\\n\\n2. **Economic Growth**: Prices play a crucial role in economic growth by influencing the allocation of resources. When prices are high, producers are incentivized to produce more, leading to an increase in supply and economic growth. Conversely, low prices can lead to a decrease in supply and economic stagnation.\\n\\n3. **International Trade**: Prices are a key determinant of international trade patterns. Countries with lower prices for goods and services tend to export more, while countries with higher prices tend to import more. This is because prices reflect the opportunity cost of production, and countries with lower prices can produce goods and services more cheaply.\\n\\n4. **Monetary Policy**: Prices are a key indicator of the effectiveness of monetary policy. Central banks use interest rates to influence the money supply and, subsequently, prices. When interest rates are low, the money supply increases, leading to higher prices. Conversely, when interest rates are high, the money supply decreases, leading to lower prices.\\n\\n5. **Supply and Demand Imbalances**: Prices can also reflect supply and demand imbalances in specific markets. When demand exceeds supply, prices rise, and when supply exceeds demand, prices fall. This can lead to economic instability and fluctuations in economic growth.\\n\\n6. **Resource Allocation**: Prices play a crucial role in resource allocation by reflecting the opportunity cost of production. When prices are high, producers are incentivized to produce more of a particular good or service, while when prices are low, producers are incentivized to produce less.\\n\\n7. **Inequality and Distribution**: Prices can also influence income inequality and distribution. When prices rise, the purchasing power of consumers decreases, leading to a decrease in the standard of living for low-income households. Conversely, when prices fall, the purchasing power of consumers increases, leading to an increase in the standard of living for low-income households.\\n\\nIn conclusion, prices are a fundamental concept in economics that extends far beyond the microeconomic realm to influence various macroeconomic phenomena.
